POML Basic Syntax¶
Estimated time to read: 2 minutes

POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language) provides a convenient way to create prompts using a markup language that is easy to read and write. The standalone file mode is the most commonly used approach, where you create a file with a .poml extension. This file contains XML-like syntax that POML renders into a prompt. This mode is particularly useful for creating reusable templates and managing complex prompts without embedding POML directly in JSX files or using a Python SDK.

In this mode, you wrap your content with a top-level <poml> tag, allowing POML to parse and render your markup correctly. Below is a guide on how to effectively use the standalone file mode.

To create a POML file, simply create a file with the .poml extension and wrap your content within the <poml> tag:


<poml>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</poml>
You can also type anything without a poml tag, and it will be treated as a string. It's called "free text mode" in POML. However, it has several limitations currently, including unabling to render any XML tags wrapped with <>, unabling to use many special characters, and unabling to use all the wonderful features of POML. So, it's always recommended to use the poml tag before everything.

Tip: Glossary for Beginners:

Tag: A tag is a fundamental building block in XML (and POML). It's used to mark the beginning and end of an element. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). For example, <p> is an opening tag, and </p> is a closing tag. Everything between the opening and closing tags is considered part of that element.
Attribute: An attribute provides additional information about an element. Attributes are placed inside the opening tag, and they consist of a name and a value (enclosed in double quotes). For example, in <p speaker="human">, speaker is the attribute name, and "human" is the attribute value.
Content: The content is the text or other elements that appear between the opening and closing tags of an element. For example, in <p>Hello, world!</p>, "Hello, world!" is the content of the <p> element.
Escape Characters: In POML, you can use escape characters to include special characters in your content and attribute values. Due to an implementation issue, the escape syntax in POML is slightly different from what you would know in HTML or XML. For example, to include a double quote (") in your content, you can use #quot; (rather than &quot;). Here are some common escape characters:

#quot; for "
#apos; for '
#amp; for &
#lt; for <
#gt; for >
#hash; for #
#lbrace; for {
#rbrace; for }
It's not necessary to use the escape characters for most cases, but they can be helpful when you are having trouble displaying those characters in certain cases.


Template Engine¶
Estimated time to read: 5 minutes

The template engine of POML allows you to incorporate dynamic content and control structures. Here are some key features.

Expressions¶
You can use expressions enclosed in double curly brackets ({{ }}) to evaluate variables or expressions dynamically:


<poml>
  <p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>
</poml>
In this example, if name is set to "Alice" (e.g., using a <let> tag, described below), the output will be "Hello, Alice!".

Usage in Attributes¶
Expressions can also be used within attribute values:


<poml>
  <task caption="Task #{{index}}">This is task No. {{index}}.</p>
</poml>
This renders to the following when index is set to 1.


# Task #1

This is task No. 1.
Expression Usages¶
POML supports various JavaScript expressions within the double curly brackets. This includes but is not limited to:

Variables: {{variableName}}
Arithmetic: {{a + b}}, {{x * y}}, {{count / total}}
String Concatenation: {{firstName + " " + lastName}}
Array Access: {{myArray[0]}}
Object Property Access: {{myObject.propertyName}}
Function Calls: {{myFunction(arg1, arg2)}} (if myFunction is defined in the context)
Ternary Operators: {{condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse}}
Accessing loop variables: {{loop.index}} (explained in the "For Attribute" section)
Let Expressions¶
The <let> tag allows you to define variables, import data from external files, and set values within your POML template.

Syntax 1: Setting a variable from a value¶

<poml>
  <let name="greeting">Hello, world!</let>
  <p>{{greeting}}</p>
</poml>
This will output "Hello, world!". When using the content approach (as shown above), the text is treated as a literal string.

Alternatively, you can use the value attribute which must contain an evaluatable JavaScript expression:


<poml>
  <let name="greeting" value="'Hello, world!'" />
  <p>{{greeting}}</p>
</poml>
Note that when using the value attribute, string literals must be properly quoted (e.g., "'Hello, world!'" or '"Hello, world!"') since the value is evaluated as JavaScript. The value attribute can contain strings, numbers, arrays, objects, or any valid JavaScript expression.

Syntax 2: Importing data from a file¶

<poml>
  <let name="users" src="users.json" />
  <p>First user: {{users[0].name}}</p>
</poml>
This imports the contents of users.json and assigns it to the users variable. The src attribute specifies the path to the file (relative to the POML file). The optional type attribute can specify the file type (e.g., "json", "text", "csv"). If not provided, POML attempts to infer it from the file extension.

Syntax 3: Importing data from a file without a name¶

<poml>
  <let src="config.json" />
  <p>API Key: {{apiKey}}</p>
</poml>
If config.json contains { "apiKey": "your_api_key" }, this will output "API Key: your_api_key". When you use src without name, and the file content is a JSON object, the properties of that object are directly added to the context.
Syntax 4: Setting a variable using inline JSON¶

<poml>
  <let name="person">
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "age": 30
    }
  </let>
  <p>Name: {{person.name}}, Age: {{person.age}}</p>
</poml>
This defines a person variable with the given JSON object. You can also specify the type attribute:


<poml>
  <let name="count" type="integer">5</let>
  <p>Count: {{count}}</p>
</poml>
Syntax 5: Setting a variable from an expression¶

<poml>
  <let name="base" value="10" />
  <let name="increment" value="5" />
  <let name="total" value="{{ base + increment }}" />
  <p>Total: {{ total }}</p>  <!-- Output: Total: 15 -->
</poml>
Type-Autocasting in Attributes¶
The attributes of components will be automatically cast based on their defined types in the component documentation. This means you don't have to worry about manually converting types in many cases.

Boolean: If an attribute is defined as a boolean, values like "true", 1, "1", or {{true}} will be cast to the boolean value true. Similarly, "false", 0, "0", or {{false}} will be cast to false.
Number: If an attribute is defined as a number, values like "123", 45.6, {{anyNumber}} or {{myNumber+1.3}} will be cast to their corresponding numeric values.
Object: If an attribute is defined as an object, POML will attempt to parse the attribute value as a JSON string. For example, data="{{{name: 'John', age: 30}}}" or data='{"name":"John","age":30}' will be parsed into the corresponding JavaScript object.
String: If an attribute is a string, no casting is performed.
In the following example, the first auto-casting happened at let, where true is converted to boolean at let expression.


<poml>
  <let name="boolVar" type="boolean" value="true"/>
  <let name="numVar" type="number" value="42"/>
  <let name="objVar" type="object" value="{{ { key: 'value' } }}"/>

  <MyComponent boolProp="{{boolVar}}" numProp="{{numVar}}" objProp="{{objVar}}" stringProp="hello"/>
</poml>
If MyComponent is defined with boolProp as boolean, numProp as number, objProp as object, and stringProp as string, the values will be interpreted and auto-casted again when MyComponent is used.

For Attribute¶
To loop over a list, use the for attribute. The syntax is for="itemName in listName".


<poml>
  <list>
    <item for="item in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']">{{item}}</item>
  </list>
</poml>
This will render a list with "apple", "banana", and "cherry".

Loop Variables¶
Inside the loop, you have access to special loop variables:

loop.index: The current iteration index (starting from 0).
loop.length: The total number of items in the list.
loop.first: true if it's the first iteration, false otherwise.
loop.last: true if it's the last iteration, false otherwise.
Example:


<poml>
<let name="all_demos" value='[
    { "input": "What is your name?", "output": "My name is POML." },
    { "input": "What can you do?", "output": "I can generate prompts." }
]'/>
  <examples>
    <example for="example in all_demos" chat="false" caption="Example {{ loop.index + 1 }}" captionStyle="header">
      <input>{{ example.input }}</input>
      <output>{{ example.output }}</output>
    </example>
  </examples>
</poml>
This will generate two examples, with captions "Example 1" and "Example 2", displaying the input and output from each demo in the all_demos array. Note that we use loop.index + 1 because loop.index starts from 0.

If Condition¶
You can conditionally render elements using the if attribute:


<poml>
  <let name="isVisible" value="true"/>
  <let name="isHidden" value="{{ !isVisible }}"/>
  <p if="isVisible">This paragraph is visible.</p>
  <p if="isHidden">This paragraph is hidden.</p>
</poml>
If isVisible is true, the first paragraph will be rendered. The second paragraph will not be rendered because isHidden is false. The value of if can be a simple variable name (which is treated as a boolean) or a POML expression.

Include Files¶
You can split prompts into multiple files and include them using the <include> tag.


<poml>
  <include src="snippet.poml" />
</poml>
The file specified in src is read and its contents are injected as if they were written in place. Variables from the current context are available inside the included file. The for and if attributes work as expected:


<poml>
  <include src="row.poml" for="i in [1,2,3]" />
  <include src="footer.poml" if="showFooter" />
</poml>


Basic Components¶
Audio¶
Audio (<audio>) embeds an audio file in the content.

Accepts either a file path (src) or base64-encoded audio data (base64). The MIME type can be provided via type or will be inferred from the file extension.

Text¶
Text (<text>, <poml>) is a wrapper for any contents. By default, it uses markdown syntax and writes the contents within it directly to the output. When used with "markup" syntaxes, it renders a standalone section preceded and followed by one blank line. It's mostly used in the root element of a prompt, but it should also work in any other places. This component will be automatically added as a wrapping root element if it's not provided: 1. If the first element is pure text contents, <poml syntax="text"> will be added. 2. If the first element is a POML component, <poml syntax="markdown"> will be added.

Usages¶
<poml syntax="text">
Contents of the whole prompt.

1. Your customized list.
2. You don't need to know anything about POML.
</poml>
To render the whole prompt in markdown syntax with a "human" speaker:

<poml syntax="markdown" speaker="human">
  <p>You are a helpful assistant.</p>
  <p>What is the capital of France?</p>
</poml>
Experimental usage with limits and priority:

<poml syntax="markdown" tokenLimit="10">
  <p priority="1">This has lower priority and may be truncated first.</p>
  <p priority="3">This has higher priority and will be preserved longer.</p>
</poml>
